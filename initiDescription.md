##  Me initial query
Hi. I want to build a web app Backend API, for a center of activities, for direct person customers, that can be families or individuals. The center can have manyh types of activities, some for anybody, some for childrens, or young childrens. Some activites are in groups, or one to one, with animator or teacher. It could be intelectual, artistic or physical activities. It can be in rooms in the center, or outside, in external places.
Do you see the kind of things I mean ?

Yes, I understand the kind of web app backend API you're envisioning. It sounds like you're looking to create a platform for a center of activities that caters to a wide range of activities for different age groups, with various formats (group or one-on-one), and possibly both indoor and outdoor settings. This platform would need to manage bookings, activity details, customer profiles, and possibly payment processing.

To help you build this, I can provide guidance on specific technologies or frameworks that might be suitable for your project, or I can outline a general architecture for such a system. Which would you prefer?
